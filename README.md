# So6 airspace filtering

Filter so6 flight trajectories intersecting a given airspace (2D) and create a simplified so6 file with Python tools

Flight and airspace data are managed with [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) dataframes, incl. intersection of trajectories with 2D airspace polygons.


## Running the tests

Run the demo_2D_filtering notebook to see how to build new so6 files from common so6 traffic files

## Built With


* [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) - GeoPandas is an open source project which extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types.
